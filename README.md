# AdminHack-bit Docker Images

Hi, I'm **AdminHack-bit** and I use Docker for many things.  
My Docker Hub username is **adminhack1**.  
I will upload most of my images to GitHub due to a Linux GPG key problem.

I'm working on a very big project:  
- An OS made in Python  
- A custom programming language named **MathLang**

## Recent Docker images

- **adminhack1/hworld-py**  
- **adminhack1/pycalc**

## How to run my Docker images

## 2025 Update:
As of now, **My Linux GPG Key problem** has been **fixed**, And, the OS was gonna be HackerOS but, I discontinued it and **MathLang**, idk if im gonna still develop it and i did: SearchCLI (not working on MCP anymore)
### PyCalc

```bash
sudo docker run --rm -it adminhack1/pycalc / docker run --rm -it adminhack1/pycalc
```
### hworld-py

```bash
sudo docker run --rm -it adminhack1/pycalc / docker run --rm -it adminhack1/pycalc
```
